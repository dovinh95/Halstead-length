## Project Title: Length of the Last Word

### Overview
This Python project offers a simple yet efficient solution to determine the length of the last word in a string. The script handles strings of varying lengths and configurations, ensuring accurate results even with leading, trailing, or multiple spaces between words.

### Problem Statement
Given a string `s` consisting of words separated by spaces, find the length of the last word in the string. A word is defined as a maximal substring consisting solely of non-space characters.

### Examples
1. **Input**: `"Hello World"`  
   **Output**: `5`  
   Explanation: The last word is "World" with length 5.

2. **Input**: `"   fly me   to   the moon  "`  
   **Output**: `4`  
   Explanation: The last word is "moon" with length 4.

3. **Input**: `"luffy is still joyboy"`  
   **Output**: `6`  
   Explanation: The last word is "joyboy" with length 6.

### Approach
The solution involves the following steps:
- Trim any trailing spaces from the string to ensure the last word can be accurately identified.
- Split the string into a list of words.
- Retrieve and return the length of the last word in the list.

### Usage
This script is useful for various applications in text processing, such as summarizing data, extracting information, or formatting text content dynamically.

### Code Snippet
```python
def length_of_last_word(s):
    return len(s.rstrip().split()[-1])
```

### Technologies
- Python
